# Welcome to My Github!

Hello, my name is Jamal. I am a passionate **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **iOS development**.
With a keen interest in building intuitve, high-performance mobile applications, I love to leverage cutting-edge technologies
to solve problems.  
 
In this repository, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my work, from iOS apps built with Swift and SwiftUI
to experiements with Machine Learning Models and computer vision algorithms. 
My goal is to constantly learn, grow, and contribute to the ever-evolving tech community.

## Key Areas of Focus:

* **iOS Development:** Building smooth, responsive apps for iPhone, iPad, and beyond using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit.  

* **Computer Vision:** Developing image processing applications and working with a popular libraries like 
OpenCV and CoreML for real-time object detection and recognition.

* **Machine Learning:** Implementing ML models and exploring new AL techniques to improve software functionalities, 
particularly in mobile applications.

## Skills & Technologies:

* **Languages:** Python, C++, Swift, Objective-C  
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** SwiftUI, UIKit, CoreML, TensorFlow, OpenCV  
* **Tools:** Xcode, Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Docker
